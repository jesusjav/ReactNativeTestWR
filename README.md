# ReactNativeTestWR

Things to do:

1. Make a better layout, improve UI with React native elements library.

2. Separate Expandablecomponent away from app functional class to make it reusable. i have many usestate (follow and blocked) with diferents cases that could be separated.(SOC)

3. Add empty layout when there's no results or server problems.

4. Add unfollow funcionality.

5. Separate all in screens(folder) with react navigation.

6. Add images and more info from the user in the list.

7. I'll try to create hooks for fetching data and use it as state, this way we can reuse in other parts of the app.

8. Include redux to keep data in sync and responsive having a single source of truth.

9. Add database store to see data offline, redux asynctorage middleware.

10. Use Jest, never use it but id like to try. must be fun.

Hope you find it useful!
